    "A manufacturing company is located in a certain city. Their goods need to be shipped to other cities that are connected with bidirectional roads, though some cities may not be accessible because roads don't connect to them. The order of deliveries is determined first by distance, then by priority. Given the number of cities, their connections via roads, and what city the manufacturing company is located in, determine the order of cities where the goods will be delivered.\n",

    "For example, let's say that the number of cities is cityNodes = 4, where cityFrom = [1, 2, 2], cityTo = [2, 3, 4], and company = 1. In other words, the manufacturing company is located in city 1, and the roads run between cities 1 and 2, cities 2 and 3, and cities 2 and 4, like so:\n",

    "The next-closest city (or cities) is visited next. This is city 3 and city 4, which are both 2 units from the manufacturing company.\n",
    "In this case, priority is then calculated, visiting the smaller-numbered city first (city 3) and continuing in ascending order (city 4).\n",
